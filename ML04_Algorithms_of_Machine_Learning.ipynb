    "## Types of Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning can be broadly classified into three main types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Supervised Learning**:\n",
    "   - In supervised learning, the model is trained on a labeled dataset, which means that each training example is paired with an output label.\n",
    "   - The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs so that the model can predict the output for new, unseen inputs.\n",
    "   - Common algorithms: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Unsupervised Learning**:\n",
    "   - In unsupervised learning, the model is trained on an unlabeled dataset, meaning there are no output labels provided.\n",
    "   - The goal is to find hidden patterns or structures in the data.\n",
    "   - Common algorithms: K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Autoencoders.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reinforcement Learning**:\n",
    "   - In reinforcement learning, an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize some notion of cumulative reward.\n",
    "   - The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties based on its actions.\n",
    "   - Common algorithms: Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN), Policy Gradient Methods.\n",

    "## Supervised Learning Algorithms\n",
    "1. **Linear Regression**: Used for predicting continuous values by fitting a linear relationship between input features and the target variable.\n",
    "2. **Logistic Regression**: Used for binary classification tasks by modeling the probability of a binary outcome.\n",
    "3. **Decision Trees**: A tree-like model used for both classification and regression tasks by splitting the data based on feature values.\n",
    "4. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: A powerful classification algorithm that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate different classes in the feature space.\n",
    "5. **Neural Networks**: A set of algorithms modeled after the human brain, used for complex tasks such as image and speech recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unsupervised Learning Algorithms\n",
    "1. **K-Means Clustering**: A clustering algorithm that partitions data into K distinct clusters based on feature similarity.\n",
    "2. **Hierarchical Clustering**: A method of cluster analysis that builds a hierarchy of clusters either through agglomerative or divisive approaches.\n",
    "3. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: A dimensionality reduction technique that transforms data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving as much variance as possible.\n",
    "4. **Autoencoders**: A type of neural network used for unsupervised learning of efficient codings, often for dimensionality reduction or feature learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reinforcement Learning Algorithms\n",
    "1. **Q-Learning**: A model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that learns the value of actions in a given state to maximize cumulative reward.\n",
    "2. **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**: An extension of Q-learning that uses deep neural networks to approximate the Q-value function.\n",
    "3. **Policy Gradient Methods**: A class of algorithms that optimize the policy directly by maximizing the expected reward through gradient ascent techniques.\n",
